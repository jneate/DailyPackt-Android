# Packt Daily

A simple Android application for keeping tabs on Packt's daily free book giveaway.

## Use Case

I used a Python program, which I contributed to, in order to collect my free book for me every time I turned on my PC. It was magical.

However, I'm not always with my computer to turn it on and run the program and also I don't always want what Packt has offered for the day.

I created this app in order to allow me to quickly view the free book of the day, before making a decision on whether I wanted it or not (without being pestered to buy something via full-page adverts)
